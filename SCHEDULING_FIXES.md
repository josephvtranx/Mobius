# Scheduling System Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **CSS Style Conflicts**

#### Problem:
- Multiple CSS files were defining conflicting styles for the same elements
- `.rbc-event` styles were defined in both `SmartSchedulingCalendar.css` and `InstructorRoster.css` with different properties
- `.calendar-event` styles had multiple conflicting definitions
- Z-index conflicts between different event types

#### Solution:
- **Made all calendar styles specific to the smart scheduling component** by prefixing with `.smart-scheduling-calendar`
- **Removed duplicate and conflicting styles** from the main CSS files
- **Organized styles into logical sections** with clear comments
- **Fixed z-index hierarchy** for proper event layering

### 2. **JavaScript Logic Issues**

#### Problem:
- Complex and conflicting event handlers in `SmartSchedulingCalendar.jsx`
- Inconsistent drag and drop behavior
- Event selection logic conflicts with manual click handling
- Excessive console logging and debugging code

#### Solution:
- **Simplified event handling logic** by removing redundant handlers
- **Fixed drag and drop functionality** to be more reliable
- **Removed conflicting event handlers** and streamlined the code
- **Cleaned up debugging code** and console logs
- **Improved event component rendering** with better separation of concerns

### 3. **Layout and Responsiveness Issues**

#### Problem:
- Form layout conflicts between different screen sizes
- Calendar height was hardcoded
- Mobile responsiveness issues in the scheduling interface
- Inconsistent spacing and alignment

#### Solution:
- **Improved responsive design** with better breakpoints
- **Fixed form layout** to work properly on all screen sizes
- **Added proper flexbox and grid layouts** for better alignment
- **Enhanced mobile experience** with stacked layouts on small screens
